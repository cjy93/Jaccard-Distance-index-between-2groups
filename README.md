# Jaccard-Similarity-index-between-2groups
Disclaimer: The true dataset is replaced with a dummy as the true dataset is highly confidential  

The purpose of this exercise is to compare the UnitPerHrs (which will translate to efficiency between 2 groups of workers), Between Singapore(SG)
as well as China(CN)

However, the names of the Activities list between the 2 countries are named very differently for what we think to be the same activity taken.

Hence ** Jaccard Similarity Index** is used to distinguish the nearest top 3 matching activity names before users use eyeball check / other ways 
to ascertain the match of Activity.

After that we just perform the percentage difference of UnitsPerHrs.

Result as follows
